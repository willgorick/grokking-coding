"""
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

Time Complexity: O(n) because for each iteration of the loop either i increases or r decreases
Space Complexity: O(1) because sorting in place
